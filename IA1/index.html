                <p class="originalText" aria-hidden="false">
                    These days, Singapore is a center of the world,
                    and Vishnu is one of its global citizens. After
                    graduating from one of India’s technology
                    colleges, he went to a postgraduate program at
                    the National University of Malaysia. His work on
                    visualizing data landed him a job with a
                    multinational medical technology company.
                    Vishnu was diagnosed with glaucoma and his
                    eyes have been getting steadily worse, despite
                    treatment. He can adjust his monitor and his
                    phone, but many of the technical programs he
                    uses don’t have many options, so he has started
                    using a screen magnifier and high-contrast mode.
                    He has several mobile phones. One connects him
                    to his family in India, one is for work, and one is
                    for personal use. He’s lucky to have good
                    bandwidth at home and at work. Some of his
                    colleagues from the university live in places with
                    much more erratic connections. Even so,
                    downloading large pages from European or U.S.
                    servers can be slow. But, if he had one wish, it
                    would be that people would write technical
                    papers and websites more clearly. His English is
                    good, but idiomatic expressions can still be hard.
